# sheepshead-webapp

This is an HTML 5 / JavaScript client for playing Sheepshead. The client itself
connects with a game server, the module for which is available in the
`sheepshead` repository.

All user information is handled by the game server. The goal will be to keep the
client as "dumb" as possible.
